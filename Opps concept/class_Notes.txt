Opps class notes:

class has attributes or variable and which are public to the class.
and can be accessed using myclass.myattributes.

object:
it is an instance of a class.
has state or attribute, behavior and identity.

state or attribute is a variable of of instance.
name of the object is called identity.
behavior it represent by the method of a class.

method:  a function inside a class is called as method.


caling method::
print(emp1.fullname()) obj.method 
print(emp2.fullname())

#or
print(Employee.fullname(emp1))  # class.method(obj)
print(Employee.fullname(emp1))  # class.method(obj)

Above two method are both one and the same.

error with method with passin self:
 fullname() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
 
 
class variable:
    class variable is public to all the objects and same to all the object within class.
