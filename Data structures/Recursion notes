Recursion notes.

A function which called itself again and again is called recursion.
A big complex problem which consist of same smaller problem is called Recursion.

A head recursion is consist of a:
    ! A base case or a stop condition.
    ! Need a recursive relation.
    ! And then returning the function for the other left problem.or doing some processing.

A tail recursion is consist of a:
    ! A base case or a stop condition.
    ! Need a recursive relation.
    ! will do some processing.
