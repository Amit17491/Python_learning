List of error and their explaination:


The Problem: typeerror: ‘int’ object is not iterable

“typeerror: ‘int’ object is not iterable”

There are two parts to this error message: TypeError and the error message.

A TypeError is raised when a function is applied to an object of the wrong data type. For instance, if you try to apply a mathematical function to a string, or call a value like a function which is not a function, a TypeError is raised.

The error message tells us that you have tried to iterate over an object that is not iterable. Iterable objects are items whose values you can access using a “for loop”.


Functions
code reusing functions
Define functions , pass arguments into functions, exrtact return values from function,
functions that changes the state of the program, that is, have observable effect other than their return values, are said to have side effects.

function with side effects are hard to parallelize and use in a distributed envirnoment.

correct ways of returning values from fucntions as well as of invoking function using both positional and keyword arguments.

keyword agruments also known as named arguments are a great way of making the intent behind function invocation absolutely explicit.
